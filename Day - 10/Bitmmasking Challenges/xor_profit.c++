/*
We are given two coins of value x and y. We have to find the maximum of value of a XOR b where x <= a <= b <= y.

Input Format
We are given two integers x and y

Constraints
l <= r <= 1000

Output Format
Print the maximum value of a XOR b

Sample Input
5
6
Sample Output
3

Explanation
If a and b are taken to be 5. Then a xor b = 0
If a and b are taken to be 6. Then a xor b = 0
If a is 5 and b is 6. Then a xor b is 3.
